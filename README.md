# AEGIS  - The Shield

AEGIS is a travel safety application inspired by the functionalities of Circle of Six and Disha applications. The app is designed to enhance user safety during journeys by incorporating alert mechanisms and emergency response features.

### Journey Setup

1. **Enter Starting and Destination Points:**
   - Users are required to input their starting and destination points to set up their journey.

2. **Vehicle Information:**
   - Users can enter the vehicle number or capture a picture of the vehicle to associate it with their journey.

3. **Time Period Alert:**
   - Users specify a time period (e.g., 30 minutes to 1 hour) for their journey.

### Alert System

- **Continuous Alerts:**
  - Once the journey starts, the app sends periodic alerts to the user within the specified time period.

- **Missed Alerts:**
  - If the user misses two consecutive alerts, the emergency contacts provided during sign-up are automatically alerted.

### Emergency Contacts

- **User-defined Emergency Contacts:**
  - Users can set up emergency contacts during the sign-up process.

- **Alert Notification:**
  - Emergency contacts receive an alert and have the ability to respond even if they cannot reach the user.

### Emergency Response

- **Help Center Alert:**
  - Upon receiving a signal from the emergency contacts, the app alerts the nearby help center.

- **Live Location Sharing:**
  - The app automatically sends the user's live location to the designated help center.
